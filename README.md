## Objective
This idea started off with the idea of "I don't know what I don't know" when it comes to consuming things like books, music and movies. Every recommendation system is trying to keep you within your bubble of interests but we want to build something that makes you aware of what else is out there, especially to try something new for the first time.

The purpose of this project is to compare a user's book classifications to the total available classifications. One way this is done is by using the Dewey Decimal System. Most data visulizations show what you have consumed but not what you HAVEN'T consumed.  
## Background

This project uses Flask for the backend in order to return a [JSON](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/1093025/raw/05621a578a66fba4d2cbf5a77e2d1bb3a27ac3d4/flare.json) file to incorporate [D3 Zoomable Circle Packing Visualization](https://jeromefroe.github.io/circlepackeR/).

Here are some files which you may find helpful when diving into the project:
- `wrec-schema.jpg` - diagram of all the models
- `classify_api_flowchart.jpg` - Our project utilizes the [Classify API](http://classify.oclc.org/classify2/api_docs/index.html) to convert ISBN values to their respective dewey decimal numbers. However, the process isn't straightforward as the API actually returns an XML document of that particular book's data. The XML is converted to JSON, then parsed to find the dewey number value. This process isn't standard hence, a flowchart of the algorithm needed to be created to clarify the steps. There are still some methods missing which need to be added to the flowchart. Here is a snippet of the flowchart:

## Install

1. You can either clone the project by running`git clone https://github.com/singhshemona/recommmend.git` in your terminal or fork the project in order to contribute later: See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

## Back End

1. Set up your Python virtual environment by running `pyvenv venv` in that directory and running `source venv/bin/activate` to active it. Or create a conda environment.
2. make sure `pip` is installed
3. Install Python requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You may need to install some [build prerequisites](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites); on Debian-like systems, they include the packages `python3-dev` and `libpq-dev`. 
4. Install PostgreSQL and create an empty database, e.g. `createdb wrec`
5. Add environment variables (see next section)
6. At your terminal, run `flask db upgrade` to create the database tables
6. At your terminal run `flask run`. Click on development server shown in your terminal [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## Environment variables
Create a `.env` file at the project level and add the following:

- FLASK_APP = wrec.py
- FLASK_DEBUG = 1
- SECRET_KEY = A 24 character random string can be generated by running `python` in your terminal and typing the following one line at a time 

```
import secrets
secrets.token_hex(24)
```
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname/database
- FLASK_CONFIG=development

### Environment variables - additional notes
If you normally log in with username or password, then use the following line: `postgresql:///database`. It is recommended setting up test and production databases as well.

## Front End
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
